Originally from Italy, I have successfully completed my MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH ZÃ¼rich in October 2023. I am currently seeking admission into a PhD program to further advance my academic career and contribute to cutting-edge research in the areas of computer vision, deep learning and state estimation.

I am an enthusiastic, motivated and hard working person. I am an excellent team worker and I am able to take instructions from all levels. I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.
