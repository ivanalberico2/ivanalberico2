  I am currently a Research Assistant at the Robotics and Perception Group working on event-based vision for robotics, advised by Prof. Davide Scaramuzza. I have successfully completed my MSc in <a href="https://master-robotics.ethz.ch/">Robotics, Systems, and Control</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH ZÃ¼rich</a> in October 2023. I am currently seeking admission into a PhD program to further advance my academic career and contribute to cutting-edge research in the areas of computer vision, deep learning and state estimation.<br>

  I have recently completed an internship at <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/">NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>, where I had the chance to work on the vision system for state estimation of the Mars Science Helicopter. During my Master's Degree, I have gained quite some research experience by working on different projects in different areas of Robotics and AI. Prior to my MSc at ETH in Robotics, I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Automation Engineering at <a href="https://www.unibo.it/en">Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna</a> in 2020.<br>
