Originally from Italy, I have successfully completed my MSc in Robotics, Systems, and Control at ETH ZÃ¼rich in October 2023. I am currently seeking admission into a PhD program to further advance my academic career and contribute to cutting-edge research in the areas of computer vision, deep learning and state estimation.

I have recently completed an internship at [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/), where I had the chance to work on the vision system for state estimation of the Mars Science Helicopter. During my Master's Degree, I have gained quite some research experience by working on different projects in different areas of Robotics and AI. Prior to my MSc at ETH in Robotics, I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Automation Engineering at [Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en) in 2020.

I am an enthusiastic, motivated and hard working person. I am an excellent team worker and I am able to take instructions from all levels. I am able to work well under pressure and adhere to strict deadlines.
