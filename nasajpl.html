            In the realm of Mars robotics exploration, the groundbreaking Mid-Air Helicopter Delivery (MAHD) 
            mission concept represents a paradigm shift in Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), introducing a 
            revolutionary approach to deploy drones on the Red Planet. Unlike its predecessors, MAHD leverages 
            a jetpack to decelerate the Mars Science Helicopter (MSH) after separation from the backshell, 
            allowing it to achieve the ideal conditions for helicopter take-off in mid air. While the MAHD 
            mission concept promises significant benefits, including cost reduction, access to challenging 
            terrains, and increased payload capacity, its ambitious goals also give rise to a distinct set 
            of challenges, particularly within the domain of monocular visual-odometry frameworks employed 
            for the navigation of these technologies.

          <p>
            In this work, we conduct an extensive analysis of the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06677">range-VIO</a> 
            method under the challenging conditions of MAHD. The investigation takes place in a custom simulation environment 
            designed to replicate the intricate complexities of Mars landscapes, including rough terrain with steep 
            elevation slopes and high-altitude trajectories starting at 12 kilometers above the Martian surface. 


            The findings from our study reveal a critical limitation in the existing range-VIO approach, 
            particularly when applied to high altitudes and on highly non-planar terrains, where the assumption 
            of local planarity becomes significantly violated, leading to performance degradation. 
            
            To address this issue, we propose an innovative alternative to the range-VIO method that eliminates the need 
            for any type of ground planarity assumption, making it adaptable to any terrain structure, while 
            still being able to observe scale and mitigate error drift under constant-velocity motion and without 
            relying on prior maps. We provide a robust evaluation of this novel implementation, demonstrating its 
            effectiveness in a realistic simulation environment. By conducting exhaustive assessments using flight 
            data representative of MAHD's scenarios, we highlight the potential benefits and enhanced performance 
            of this new approach, paving the way for more adaptable and efficient navigation systems in the context 
            of Mars exploration.

          In the context of navigation, the main objective is to precisely control the jetpack's velocity, 
          maintaining it within the tight boundaries of 1 m/s. This critical phase of navigation begins after 
          heatshield separation, typically occurring at an altitude of around 12 kilometers above the Martian 
          surface. Here, terrain-relative navigation comes into play, providing essential positional accuracy.

          MAHD introduces a range of compelling advantages when compared to conventional EDL approaches. 
          One of the standout features of MAHD is the absence of a lander. Unlike the Mars 2020 mission, 
          which relies on the sky-crane to execute the descent, MAHD optimizes the available space within 
          the aeroshell for larger rotorcraft. This elimination of the lander represents a significant cost 
          reduction, making missions more economically feasible. In addition to that, MAHD simplifies the 
          EDL system, reducing mission complexity and associated costs substantially. The streamlined 
          architecture enhances efficiency and reliability during the critical descent and landing phases. 
          Lastly, building upon the success of the Mars Science Helicopter, MAHD extends the reach of 
          exploration by providing access to hazardous and higher-elevation terrains on Mars and therefore 
          opening up new possibilities for scientific investigation. These advantages position MAHD as a 
          highly promising EDL solution for Mars missions, particularly those focused on helicopter-only 
          endeavors, such as the Mars Science Helicopter. MAHD not only enhances cost-effectiveness and 
          mission feasibility but also broadens the horizons of Martian exploration by venturing into 
          challenging terrains that were once out of reach.

        <br>
        <br>
        In the context of navigation, the main objective is to precisely control the jetpack's velocity, 
        maintaining it within the tight boundaries of 1 m/s. This critical phase of navigation begins 
        after heatshield separation, typically occurring at an altitude of around 12 kilometers above 
        the Martian surface. Here, terrain-relative navigation comes into play, providing essential 
        positional accuracy.

        During this descent phase, the primary focus is on accurately estimating the vehicle's velocity, 
        a pivotal factor for both the safe landing and the subsequent control of the jetpack in the final 
        stages of descent.
        
        To meet the stringent mission specifications, the navigation system aims to provide velocity 
        estimates well within the 3σ bounds of 1 m/s. This level of precision is indispensable for 
        maintaining a stable hover and facilitating a secure transition to powered flight.

          <br>

          <br>

          The navigation challenges of the Mars Science Helicopter are multifaceted and intricate. 
          First and foremost, navigating over the highly non-planar Martian terrain, exemplified by 
          regions like Valles Marineris with its substantial altitude variations of ±4 km, as it is 
          shown in Figure 1.6, demands a navigation system that can swiftly adapt to changes in 
          altitude and negotiate the rugged landscape effectively.
          
          Secondly, the initialization of the state estimator under the uncertain and demanding 
          conditions of MAHD is a critical concern. The prior knowledge of the helicopter's state 
          may not suffice for achieving convergence and precise state estimation during descent, 
          necessitating the potential implementation of an independent initialization module for 
          the Kalman Filter.
          
          Furthermore, MAHD encounters phases of constant velocity motion, particularly during 
          the parachute and jetpack terrain-relative hover phases 1 . The constant velocity 
          motion in the latter two phases poses challenges for motion estimation, as it lacks 
          the IMU sensor excitations observed in more dynamic maneuvers. To address this, 
          integrating additional sensors like altimeters becomes imperative to disambiguate 
          scale information.
          
          Lastly, MAHD conducts terrain-relative navigation without access to prior maps of the 
          Martian surface. Instead, it relies on continuous comparisons of sensor data with 
          observed terrain features in real-time. While this approach enables the system to 
          determine its position and orientation relative to the local terrain, it cannot 
          correct x and y position errors in an absolute sense, only relative to the initial 
          guess fed into the state estimation framework.

            One of the contributions of this work lies in the development of a highly sophisticated 
            and comprehensive simulation environment tailored specifically for Mid-Air Helicopter 
            Delivery operations on Mars. The importance of such a simulation environment cannot 
            be overstated, as it serves as a fundamental tool for advancing our understanding in 
            this unique and challenging field of planetary exploration.

          <br>


          In order to achieve the highest level of precision in the novel simulation environment, 
          we use Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) of various Martian sites sourced from the High-Resolution 
          Imaging Science Experiment (<a href="https://www.uahirise.org">HiRISE</a>) website. 
          HiRISE data are derived from measurements  taken by an orbiting spacecraft equipped 
          with a powerful camera capable of capturing images covering extensive Martian terrain 
          while discerning features with a resolution of about 1 meter.

          The complete functionality of the proposed hybrid simulator is achieved through a series 
          of key steps. Firstly, we have seamlessly integrated an external trajectory generator 
          package with Unity, namely the <a href="https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python">Robotics Toolbox</a> 
          package, allowing us to dynamically control the drone's position and orientation within 
          the rendering engine over time. IMU data generation is then carried out offline, synchronized 
          with the input trajectory provided to the rendering engine. For image generation, we make 
          use of pre-existing pinhole camera models within Unity, configured to have a downward perspective, 
          and Airsim is employed through an existing Python API for image capture. Additionally, we have 
          implemented a C# model for an altimeter sensor, emulating a downward-facing 1D-LRF, which 
          employs ray-tracing techniques on the rendered 3D model to determine the distance between 
          the drone and the ground. To manage the altimeter data collected from Unity, we have developed 
          a dedicated Python API.

            The primary contribution of this thesis revolves around the integration 
            of 1D Laser Range Finder measurements into the visual-odometry framework 
            employed by the Mars Science Helicopter, denoted as xVIO. What sets this 
            method apart is its capacity to perform this integration without necessitating 
            any assumptions regarding the terrain's planarity. 

            <strong>Selection criteria for range-based features</strong>

            Before adding a range-feature to the SLAM tracks for the visual update, we have to 
            make sure that the feature represents a corner and that it can be tracked over time. 
            In order to determine that, we make use of the minimum eigenvalue score metrics that 
            computes the minimum eigenvalue of the spatial gradient matrix. A new range-feature 
            is determined when both of the following conditions are satisfied:
            <li>The minimum eigenvalue score is above a predefined threshold;</li>
            <li>The score value at time t is greater than the score computed in the subsequent N 
            iterations, with N being a parameter specified at run-time.</li>

            <br>
            
            <strong>Range-features initialization</strong>
            
            Once a pixel satisfies the conditions elucidated in the preceding section, it becomes 
            a candidate for inclusion in the feature matches and subsequently undergoes tracking, 
            following a protocol similar to that of any other SLAM feature. As it persists in being 
            tracked for a duration exceeding the minimum track length parameter specified at run-time, 
            it attains eligibility for inclusion in the set of SLAM tracks used for updates. What sets 
            it apart from the other SLAM tracks is the intentional effort to guarantee the inclusion 
            of the range-feature within these tracks, and additionally the way these features are 
            initialized.
            
            Once the range feature has been added to the SLAM tracks, the update rule for that feature 
            follows the same pattern of any other SLAM feature.

          <br>

          <strong>Scale observability with range-feature initialization</strong>
          
          The primary objective of range-feature initialization revolves around testing the 
          algorithm's effectiveness for scale observability. The trajectory employed for 
          evaluation purposes takes a simpler form, characterized by a horizontal path 
          featuring a velocity vector of [50, 0, 0] m/s, staying the whole time at an 
          elevation of 12 km above a uniformly flat terrain.
          
          The sequence is analyzed within the same analytical framework as previously 
          described, although with the introduction of initial condition errors. Specifically, 
          a 20% error is imposed upon the initial position, contributing to a perturbation in 
          the scale aspect of the feature plane. Additionally, a 20% error is applied to the 
          norm of the velocity vector, thereby establishing an overall scale error of 20%. 
          With particular focus on the x-axis, representing the principal direction of motion, 
          the results illustrated by the plots are noteworthy. In the absence of range-feature 
          initialization, the scale factor remains unobserved.

          <br>


          <strong>Improved performance on MAHD trajectories</strong>

          This section serves as a more in-depth assessment within a single MAHD-like sequence, 
          aiming to highlight the impact of range-feature initialization. The primary focus is 
          on the velocity error along the z-axis, with a specific interest in observing the 
          effectiveness of range-feature initialization in mitigating drift. In the trajectory 
          under consideration, different from the one showcased before, the true velocity of the 
          drone is [−10, −1, −55] m/s, and the trajectory covers a range from 12 kilometers down 
          to 200 meters.

          The true effectiveness of the novel algorithm becomes more apparent when dealing with 
          the inherent randomness and complexities of MAHD. In this case, while comparing the 
          vision-only method to the one with range-features, we observe a divergence behavior 
          in the velocity along the z-axis for the vision-only method. In contrast, the 
          range-features initialization approach consistently keeps the error close to zero 
          throughout the entire sequence. This outcome serves as another validation of the 
          effectiveness of the implemented method in challenging MAHD scenarios. Deploying 
          the range-feature initialization method allows us to reduce the final 3σ bound 
          on the velocity from [1.613, 1.707, 3.653] m/s to [1.115, 0.983, 0.608] m/s.
